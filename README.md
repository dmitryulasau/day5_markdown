To make custom heading IDs work with VS code install Markdown Preview

# (h1) This is a heading (h1)

## (h2) This is a smaller heading (h2)

### (h3) This is the same as a (h3)

#### (h4) Be sure to add a space agter the # for copabtility (h4)

##### (h5) We can use Ctrl-Shift-V to view this markdown (h5)

###### (h6) add a line breaks after your headings (h6)

I am a paragraph do not indent me. Just write here to start writtin on a new line. Add trailing-white space aka three spaces to the end of the line like so  
now I am on a new line

or we can leave a full space between lines to start a new paragraph or we can use HTML in markdown and use the `<br>` tag: <br>I am on a new line

You can write in **bold** or in _italic_ or **_both at the same time_**

    We can even put out text in boxes using **TAB**

## Lists

We can make ordered lists:

1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

The numbering does not matter as long as you start with nnumber 1

1. item 1
1. item 2
1. item 3
1. item 1
1. item 2
1. item 3

We can aslo make unordered lists:

- first item
- second item
- third item

##HR

We can make a horizontal rule

## Images

## Code Block

We can add a line of code \`

We cam also add code block with \`\`\`

```
def my_function(name):
    return f"Hello {name}"
```

## More Information

There are a lot of different flavors of markdown out there for instance GitHub has its own flavor. These commands should be universal though to all markdown languages

There are more options you can learn like embedding these elements inside each other, making footnotes, task lists, definitions list etc. If you want to learn more visit: [Markdown Home Page](https://www.markdownguide.org)

There is also an extended syntax that is avaliable in many markdown applications that I hav not shown here. You can learn more at the Markdown homepage by scrolling to Extend Syntax section of the markdown website

The links to the parts of the page in this designed to work with GitHub and may not work will all markdown applications. For more information GitHub flavor visit: [Link](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
